# Directory Structure

The current plan for Phalcon is to use the `.phalcon` directory using being used by Phalcon devtools, but poorly utilized, for storing information related to command line to keep track of the application state.  
Using a unified directory name for all projects i.e. `.phalcon` will help unify the setup process for applications, and help with establishing a standardized practice to help users' understanding.
